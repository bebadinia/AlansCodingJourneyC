board_content = @"Before every section, you are able to click on the chalkboard to extend it.
Doing this will extend it, much like this, but will show you information to help you with the upcoming challenges.

The information is based on Dr.Redfield's 'C Programming Workbook'. 
Each section during your journey is based on each chapter with the relevant name.
So, every level will contain 3 sections which equal 112 total sections.
To get the full experience and become a coding master, please make sure to complete the coding challenges at the end of each chapter on your own device using the recommended IDE (Dev C++).
